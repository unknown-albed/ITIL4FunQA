# 🌐 GitHub Pages Setup Guide - ITIL® 4 Foundation Quiz App

## 🚨 **Fixing the 404 Error**

You're seeing a 404 error because GitHub Pages needs to be properly configured. Here's how to fix it:

---

## ⚡ **Quick Fix (2 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages**
1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   - Visit: https://github.com/unknown-albed/ITIL4FunQA/settings
   - Scroll down to **"Pages"** section

2. **Configure Source**:
   - **Source**: Select **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
   - This is crucial for Flutter web apps!

3. **Save Settings**:
   - Click **"Save"** if there's a save button
   - The page should show: "Your site is being built from GitHub Actions"

### **Step 2: Trigger Deployment**
The deployment should start automatically after the above push, but you can also:

1. **Check Actions Tab**:
   - Visit: https://github.com/unknown-albed/ITIL4FunQA/actions
   - Look for "Deploy Web App to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - It should be running or queued

2. **Manual Trigger** (if needed):
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Click "Deploy Web App to GitHub Pages"
   - Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"

---

## 🔍 **Current Status**

### **✅ What's Already Done:**
- ✅ Repository is public (required for free GitHub Pages)
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow is configured
- ✅ Flutter web app is built and ready
- ✅ `.nojekyll` file added (prevents Jekyll conflicts)
- ✅ Temporary `index.html` shows deployment status

### **⏳ What's Happening Now:**
1. **GitHub Actions** is building your Flutter web app
2. **Deployment** will serve the app at `/ITIL4FunQA/` path
3. **Root URL** shows deployment status with auto-refresh
4. **Automatic redirect** when deployment completes

---

## 🎯 **Expected URLs**

### **After Deployment Completes:**
- **Main App**: https://unknown-albed.github.io/ITIL4FunQA/
- **Root Page**: https://unknown-albed.github.io/ITIL4FunQA (redirects to app)
- **Status Page**: https://unknown-albed.github.io/ITIL4FunQA/ (temporary, until deployment)

### **Timeline:**
- **Initial Setup**: 2-5 minutes
- **Subsequent Updates**: 1-2 minutes (automatic on push)

---

## 🛠️ **Manual GitHub Pages Setup**

If you need to configure it manually:

### **Repository Settings:**
1. **Navigate to Settings**:
   ```
   https://github.com/unknown-albed/ITIL4FunQA/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Source Configuration**:
   ```
   Source: GitHub Actions
   Custom domain: (leave blank for now)
   Enforce HTTPS: ✅ (should be checked)
   ```

3. **Permissions Check**:
   - Go to Settings → Actions → General
   - Ensure "Read and write permissions" is selected
   - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If 404 Persists:**

#### **Check 1: GitHub Pages Source**
```bash
# Verify Pages is set to "GitHub Actions"
# NOT "Deploy from a branch"
```

#### **Check 2: Workflow Status**
1. Visit: https://github.com/unknown-albed/ITIL4FunQA/actions
2. Look for latest "Deploy Web App to GitHub Pages"
3. Check if it's:
   - ✅ **Completed** (green checkmark)
   - ⏳ **Running** (yellow circle)
   - ❌ **Failed** (red X) - click to see error

#### **Check 3: Repository Permissions**
- Repository must be **public** ✅ (you've done this)
- Actions must have **write permissions**
- Pages must be **enabled**

#### **Check 4: Manual Workflow Trigger**
```bash
# If workflow hasn't run automatically:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Deploy Web App to GitHub Pages"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select "main" branch
5. Click "Run workflow"
```
